1. Executive Summary
This report assesses the feasibility of the LapPrice project, a web-based tool designed to predict laptop prices using machine learning. The analysis covers three core areas: Technical, Data, and Operational feasibility. The assessment concludes that the project is highly feasible due to the use of proven technologies, the availability of public data, and the low operational overhead of the deployed application. The successful development of a working prototype further validates this conclusion.

2. Project Scope and Objectives
The primary objective of the LapPrice project is to address the information asymmetry in the laptop market. By providing consumers with an unbiased, data-driven price prediction based on core technical specifications (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage), the tool aims to empower users to make more informed purchasing decisions.

3. Technical Feasibility
Assessment: High

Analysis: The technical components required for this project are mature, well-documented, and readily available. The core prediction model has already been successfully developed and deployed, which removes any uncertainty regarding technical viability.

Technology Stack:

Language: Python 3.x

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Web Framework: Streamlit

Model Persistence: Pickle

Expertise: The required skills in Python programming, data science, and model deployment are already present within the project team, as demonstrated by the existing prototype.

Conclusion: There are no significant technical barriers to the successful implementation and maintenance of this project. The chosen tech stack is robust, scalable for future enhancements, and standard within the industry.

4. Data Feasibility
Assessment: High

Analysis: The project's success hinges on access to a large and relevant dataset of laptop specifications and prices. This has been addressed by utilizing publicly available data.

Data Sourcing: The initial dataset was acquired via web scraping of major e-commerce websites. This method is cost-effective and ensures the data reflects real-world market conditions.

Reproducibility: The use of a public dataset ensures that the model's performance can be independently verified and reproduced, adding to the project's credibility.

Data Quality & Volume: While the initial dataset was sufficient for a proof-of-concept with high accuracy (R-squared of 0.90), the feasibility of expanding the dataset is also high, which will be crucial for future model improvements.

Conclusion: The data required for the project is accessible at a low cost, making this aspect highly feasible.

5. Operational Feasibility
Assessment: High

Analysis: This section evaluates how the project will function once deployed and whether it fits into a practical, sustainable operational model.

Deployment: The application is deployed as a lightweight web application using Streamlit. This framework is designed for rapid development and requires minimal server resources compared to more complex web frameworks.

Maintenance: The operational costs are expected to be low. The primary maintenance tasks will involve periodic re-training of the model with new data, which can be automated. Server hosting costs will be minimal due to the application's efficiency.

User Acceptance: The user interface is intentionally simple and intuitive (a web form for input, a clear output for the price). It requires no specialized training for the end-user, ensuring high operational acceptance among the target audience (general consumers).

Conclusion: The project is operationally feasible, with a clear path to deployment, low maintenance overhead, and a user-centric design that ensures it can be easily used as intended.

6. Overall Conclusion and Recommendation
The LapPrice project is deemed highly feasible across all critical dimensions of assessment.

It is technically sound, built on a proven and efficient technology stack.

It is data-feasible, relying on accessible public data.

It is operationally practical, with a low-cost deployment and maintenance plan.

The existence of a functional prototype with strong performance metrics serves as definitive proof of this feasibility.

Recommendation: The project should proceed as planned, with a focus on gathering more extensive data for future iterations and exploring advanced models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
