Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Laptop Price Predictor
1. Introduction




1.1 Purpose


The purpose of the Laptop Price Predictor project is to develop a web application powered by a machine learning model that can predict the market price of a laptop based on its desired configuration. This application aims to assist students and working professionals in determining the appropriate price point for a new laptop with specific features.


1.2 Scope


The project encompasses the entire machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and finally, deployment of a web application. The web application will serve as a user interface for users to input laptop configurations and receive a price prediction.


1.3 Target Audience

The primary users of this system are students and working professionals who are looking to purchase a new laptop and wish to understand the market price for specific configurations.





2. Overall Description


2.1 Product Perspective

The Laptop Price Predictor is a standalone web application. It integrates a machine learning model as its backend, which performs the core price prediction functionality. The frontend is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.


2.2 System Architecture (High-Level)

The system broadly consists of:
• Data Layer: The laptop_df.csv dataset.
• Backend (Machine Learning Model): Python-based machine learning model developed using libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, etc.. This includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the trained prediction model.
• Frontend (Web Application): A Streamlit-based web interface for user input and displaying predictions.
• Deployment Platform: Heroku (or similar cloud platform) for hosting the web application.






2.3 User Interface Description
The web application provides a simple and intuitive user interface. Users will be presented with a series of basic questions and input fields to specify the desired laptop configuration.
Key UI elements include:
• Dropdown menus for categorical features (e.g., Brand, Type Name, CPU Brand, GPU Brand, Operating System).
• Number input fields for numerical features (e.g., RAM in GB, Weight in kg, Screen Size in inches, HDD/SSD capacity in GB).
• Select boxes for binary features (e.g., Touchscreen: Yes/No, IPS Display: Yes/No).
• A pre-defined list of common screen resolutions.
• A "Predict Price" button to initiate the prediction process.
• A display area for the predicted price, presented in Indian Rupees.









3. Functional Requirements
The system shall perform the following functions:
3.1 Data Preprocessing
• FR1.1: The system shall import the laptop_df.csv dataset.
• FR1.2: The system shall drop irrelevant columns such as Unnamed: 0.
• FR1.3: The system shall clean the 'RAM' column by removing "GB" and converting the data type to integer.
• FR1.4: The system shall clean the 'Weight' column by removing "kg" and converting the data type to float.
• FR1.5: The system shall check for and handle duplicate rows (though none were found in the provided dataset).
• FR1.6: The system shall check for and handle missing values (though none were found in the provided dataset).
3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• FR2.1: The system shall analyze the distribution of laptop prices, noting its skewed nature.
• FR2.2: The system shall analyze the distribution of laptop brands, identifying popular brands (e.g., Lenovo, Dell, HP).
• FR2.3: The system shall calculate and visualize the average price per laptop brand.
• FR2.4: The system shall analyze the distribution of laptop types (e.g., Notebook, Gaming, Ultrabook).
• FR2.5: The system shall calculate and visualize the average price per laptop type.
• FR2.6: The system shall analyze the distribution of screen sizes.
• FR2.7: The system shall visualize the relationship between screen size and price
