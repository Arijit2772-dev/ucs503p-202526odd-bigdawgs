 attributes i am considering lets see which one is
 worth to be in our dataset and which one not..

  Company          object 
   TypeName         object 
 Inches              float64
 ScreenResolution     object 
  Cpu                 object
  Ram                 object 
  Memory             object 
 Gpu                 object 
  OpSys              object 
 Weight              object 
  Price              float64




  # how will i check that this thing is worth to keep?
  # by plotting(visulation)
  # by correaltion... ( math stats)  differnets correaltion coeefficients 
  # by regression lines ( etc) seaborn...


  # later
  Use correlation for numeric vs numeric
  group comparisons / ANOVA for categorical vs numeric
  chi-square test for categorical vs categorical


 feature engineering see 2 columns add bhi kiya...


 // data cleaning done 
 // eda doing



 // mutli collinarity check heatmap...

 F= 
 Variance WITHIN groups
 Variance BETWEEN groups


 F-statistic is large  --> so that is statically significnat 
 -statistic is small --> not statically sig ificant 

// from f-satistic find p-value(probability)
// i would take 95 percent confidence interval...
